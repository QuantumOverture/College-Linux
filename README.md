# College-Linux
Linux Tutorial aimed at college students (who have no experience working with terminal). Presented as a web app for easy access and mass use. Emphasis on "hands-on" learning via a psuedo kernal.

# Planned/Covered Topics
~~Basic use of vim,bash(for unit testing C++ programs and file management),~~ unix-file system, logging into a remote host, ~~git basics~~,~pipping~ /output redirection,~~super basic valgrind usage~~.

Latest Topics list change on 7/18/2019 --> HOWEVER, these topics might come in the future(No promises though). Piping sort of works but isn't ready and hence won't have a lesson right off the bat.

### DISCLAIMER:
I am not an extremely experienced linux user nor do I claim to be. I am just passing on stuff I learnt during my first year in college.
